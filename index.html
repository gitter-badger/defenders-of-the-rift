<h1>Defenders of the Rift</h1>
Defenders of the Rift is an open-source Customizable Card Game (CCG).
It has many of the elements you're used to finding in your favorite
commercial CCG or TCG, but it has a couple distinct differences:

<h2>It's free and open</h2>
Defenders of the Rift is free to play and free to modify. And to
that end...

<h2>You're on the team!</h2>
Defenders of the Rift is a collaborative effort. So get involved!

<h3><a href="http://coderkevin.github.io/defenders-of-the-rift/static/card-calculator.html">Card Calculator</a></h3>
The Card Calculator application is currently under development.
The purpose of it is to balance card stats and resources, as this can
be a very complex fomulation for game balance.
