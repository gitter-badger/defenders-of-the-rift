## The Story

Across the green fields of a peaceful village, the people bustle throughout the day in their menial tasks. Then, at once,
a crack sounds and electrifies the air above. Just there, above a farmer's field of crops appears something thin and
crooked--a line, a fissure actually. And it begins to widen. As this fissure begins to grow and reveal the dark depths within,
it begins drawing in...the field, the village, and more. The hungry rift begins to pull at the very world itself. As the
villagers flee for their lives, they make for the local lord, to inform him of their plight.

Before long, the entire country has heard of this strange rift and tales are spreading across the world. "It's judgement!"
exclaim some. "It's the end of the world!" others confirm. All the while, the king of the land sits on his throne, attempting
to form some response to this threat to his kingdom's very existence. And that is when the heroes arrived.

Hearing the tale of the rift carried by bards across the land, they were drawn to it. Heros of many statures and abilities
appared before the king that day, ready to lead his armies and others into dire battle for the survival of their race,
way of life, and world itself.
